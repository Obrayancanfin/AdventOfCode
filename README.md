# AdventOfCode

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, a fun and engaging way to practice programming and problem-solving skills during the holiday season.

What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, featuring a series of daily programming puzzles. Each day, a new challenge is released, which typically involves algorithmic thinking, data structures, and problem-solving. The puzzles are designed to be approachable for programmers of all skill levels, and they can be solved in any programming language.
